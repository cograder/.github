Welcome to **CoGrader** — where AI meets education (and saves teachers from endless grading 😅).

We’re building AI-powered tools that help educators grade written assignments faster, fairer, and with better feedback — without removing humans from the loop.

## 🚀 What we’re building

- 🤖 **AI-assisted grading** based on clear, customizable rubrics
- 📝 **Actionable feedback** students can actually learn from
- 🧑‍🏫 **Human-in-the-loop** workflows (teachers stay in control)
- 🔌 **LMS integrations** (Google Classroom, Canvas, Schoology, and more)

Our goal is simple:
**less time grading, more time teaching.**
